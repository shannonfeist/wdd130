        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Christian is the founder and owner of MonkeBandz. He was born in Beaver county Pennsylvania. His family moved to central Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg, when he was four years old. His love for baseball and the outdoors flourished in the beautiful countryside he called home. He learned responsibility and hard work as he helped care for animals and tend the garden on his family's hobby farm. His love for baseball led him to play on several travel teams, but he found a home with the Keystone Nationals. He learned many life lessons from his time playing with them. The slogan "Do Your Job" was on the sleave of every player's uniform. Christian was a Cub Scout. He loved learning about nature, survival skills and working as a team. It was during one of his Cub Scout day camps that he first learned about paracord crafts and their survival benefits. He made his first wristband and found he had quite a knack for it. He has continued to make those wristbands and expanded his knowledge to other items. Christian is now sixteen years old and is working to earn money for serving a mission and pay for college. He loves to serve others and be a friend to everyone.</p>
